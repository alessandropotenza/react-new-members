# Getting Started

Clone this repo, install node_modules, and recreate the provided sample program.

## Information
- Parts that are necessary to edit to complete the tasks are commented (//)
- You must only modify the App.css & App.js files

## Description of the Program to Recreate

The program should display 3 buttons and a live count. One button increments the count, another decrements the count, and the last one cycles through different labels each time it's pressed.

Once you have completed that task, mess around in the App.css to change the position, color & sizes of the button as you please. Try to familarize yourself with the CSS syntax.
